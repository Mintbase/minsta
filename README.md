3. Reload the page to reflect the changes.

### Deployed on Vercel

If you have deployed your project on Vercel, follow these steps to update your environment variables:

1. Log in to your Vercel account.
2. Navigate to the project settings for your deployed app.
3. Update the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
